# Game of Thrones Deaths Analysis

## Overview

This project is an analysis of character deaths in the TV series "Game of Thrones." It was created as my first project to learn Scala. The analysis explores various aspects of the deaths, such as who killed whom, the method used, and the context of each death, using a dataset provided in CSV format.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about each death in the show, such as:

- **Order**: Sequence of deaths.

- **Method Category**: Category for the method used (e.g., Blade, Animal).
- **Reason**: Reason for the death, if provided.
- **Location**: Where the death occurred.
- **Allegiance**: Allegiance of the character who was killed.
- **Importance**: Importance of the character.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Insights into common killers, methods, and locations of deaths.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Trends and patterns in the data, such as deadly seasons and episodes.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs to visualize the data and findings.

## Technologies Used

- **Scala**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
